##Chapter I
####An Overview of Nesty

Nesty is a nested sets package for Laravel that enhances The [Cartalyst Crud Model](https://github.com/cartalyst/crud) to use a [Nested Sets model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model). This model is unbelievably fast when retrieving a hierachical tree of data. It is so much faster than the [Adjancy List model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list) (what you're probably used to seeing) because it uses **just one** database call to retrieve an entire hierachical tree of data.

This will keep your app fast and you users happy.
